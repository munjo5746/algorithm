## Histogram Equalization
The histogram equalization is an algorithm that increase the global contrast of an image so that each objects in the
image is more distinct. 

## Otsu's thresholding
Otsu's thresholding is one of the image segmentation algorithm that extract object from the given image. This algorithm 
assumes that the input image has bi-modal histogram so that it can find the best pixel intensity value that separates
the two groups of pixels based on the intensity.

## Linear Regression with Gradient Descent
For a given set of data points, the Linear Regression algorithm finds the best line that fits the data points. The 
Gradient Descent algorithm uses derivatives to find the line with has lowest error value.
